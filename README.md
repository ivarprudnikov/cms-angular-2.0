# CMS with angular 2.0 IN PROGRESS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ivarprudnikov/cms-angular-2.0.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ivarprudnikov/cms-angular-2.0)

## [Live demo](http://ivarprudnikov.github.io/cms-angular-2.0) | [Angular 1.4 version](https://github.com/ivarprudnikov/cms-angular-1.4)

The goal here is to set up angular app that deals with content management, to see later how it compares
to an app built with older angular version.

**Requirements**

- Content is managed via service layer
- All CRUD operations
- Search and pagination
- User can create arbitrary types of content and publish it

**Storage**

Storage is going to be implemented using localStorage

**Development**

Install dependencies and `grunt serve` to run locally and watch for changes.
You can also run production version with `grunt serve:dist`.
